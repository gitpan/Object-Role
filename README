NAME
    Object::Role - base class for non-Moose roles

SYNOPSIS
     {
       package Object::Dumpable;
       use base qw/Object::Role/;
       use Data::Dumper;
       sub import
       {
         my ($class, @args) = @_;
         my ($caller, %args) = __PACKAGE__->parse_arguments(undef, @args);
         my $coderef = sub
           {
             my ($self) = @_;
             return Dumper($self);
           };
         __PACKAGE__->install_method(dump => $coderef, $caller);
       }
     }
 
     {
       package Foo;
       use Object::Dumpable;
       sub new { ... }
     }
 
     {
       package main;
       my $foo = Foo->new;
       warn $foo->dump;
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This will be better documented once I fully understand it myself!

    The idea of this is to be a base class for roles like Object::DOES,
    Object::Stash and Object::ID. It handles parsing of import arguments,
    installing methods into the caller's namespace (like Exporter, but using
    a technique that is immune to namespace::autoclean) and tracking which
    packages have consumed your role.

    While "Object::Role" is a base class for roles, it is not itself a role,
    so does not export anything. Instead, your role must inherit from it.

  Methods
    "parse_arguments($default_arg_name, @arguments)"
        Will parse:

          package My::Class;
          use My::Role -foo => 1, -bar => [2,3], 4, 5;

        as:

          (
            'My::Class',   # caller,
            (
              '-foo'             => [1],
              '-bar'             => [2, 3],
              $default_arg_name  => [4, 5],
            )
          )

    "install_method($subname => $coderef, $package)"
        Installs $coderef as "$package\::$subname".

        Automatically calls register_consumer($package).

    "register_consumer($package)"
        Records that $package has consumed (used) your role.

    "has_consumer($package)"
        Check if $package has consumed (used) your role.
